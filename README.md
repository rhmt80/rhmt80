- 🔭 Currently building driver safety products at [Cambridge Mobile Telematics](https://www.cmtelematics.com) as an iOS Developer  
- 💬 Ask me about **iOS app development, product thinking, and building emotionally thoughtful mobile experiences**  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I obsess over how apps *feel*, not just how they work — haptics, micro-interactions, and emotional design matter deeply to me  

---

### 🧠 Product Philosophy

> I believe great apps are built at the intersection of **engineering discipline, human emotion, and restraint**.
